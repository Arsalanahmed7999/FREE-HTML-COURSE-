<!-- The HTML <title> Element
        The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
        
        The <title> element is required in HTML documents!
        
        The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
        
        The <title> element:
        
        defines a title in the browser toolbar
        provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        displays a title for the page in search engine-results
        So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible! -->
