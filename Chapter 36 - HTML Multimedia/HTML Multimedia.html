<!-- HTML Multimedia -->

<!-- Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations. -->

<!-- What is Multimedia?
Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.

Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats. -->

<!-- Browser Support
The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.

Later came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedia! -->

<!-- Multimedia Formats
Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.

The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.

Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.-->


<!-- The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page. -->

    <!-- How it Works
    The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
    
    It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
    
    The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
    
    The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element. -->
    
    <!-- HTML <video> Autoplay
            To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute -->

<!-- Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed. -->

<!-- Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted) -->
